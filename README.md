Room Monitoring system using Raspberry and computer Vision.
In this project, we are trying to make a smart system that can monitor the
activity of people in a specified room. The main idea is to have a group of
sensors that can produce a variety of outputs and then collect these outputs
and analyze it.Based on the acquired outputs, the system has to tell the user
about the status of the specified room, meaning that the system must know
the following:-

1. The number of people who left Room A.

2. The number of people who entered Room A.

3. The number of current people in Room A.

Our smart system must then present the data in a Mobile Application with
real-time data about the status of Room A. This smart system requires the
use of sensors and a micro-controller.
